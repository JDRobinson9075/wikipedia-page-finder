# Wikipedia Page Finder
This is a very simple example of using an API implementation ('wikipediaapi' and 'webbrowser') to find Wikipedia pages.

# Prerequisites
This code requires:
- 'wikipediaapi'
to be installed. You can do this via:
- 'pip install wikipediaapi'.

# Usage
All you need to do is run:

- python wikipagecode.py

in your terminal. Then, simply type in a term and the api should find you the page. It can even find it using
abbreviations/short terms ('The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind' can be simply found using 'Morrowind' for example).

Simply type 'exit' to leave the program.
